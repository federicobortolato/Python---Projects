Outside's raining... you are all wet and cold. You're wearing only an old hemp sack sewed together...
while knocking on the orphanage door, you're trembling. A pretty lady opens the door. -What are you doing there?- she asks.
-My parents died in the fire that reached our farm a few days ago. I'm alone now-. -Come in- the woman says.
She takes you to the canteen and offers you a warm soup. While checking you out she can't tell if you're a
boy or a girl, probably your short hair and your young face confuses her.'

She seems quite anxious. While giving you a glass with some red-purple-like liquid inside she tells you to drink it.
-It will warm you-. Beside the strong smell, it's not that bad and you immediately feel a fire flowing from your stomach to your head.
She sits in front of you and watches you eating for some time.

-Stay here-. She goes out of the room. You can hardly listen to her speaking with some other woman, probably older.
After a while she comes back. -Ok {}, we'll let
you stay here for the night-. The sun has already gone, so she takes you to a free bed in the dormitory. -Good night- and leaves you alone
with some other guys, already sleeping'
